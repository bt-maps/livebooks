# Livebooks



This is a short interactive guide to asynchronous data processing in Elixir. It
uses [Livebook][livebook] to show interactive Elixir snippets that you can run
on your own machine.

## How Do I Use This?

Using the badges below, you can import them to your computer and run and explore them there. My recommendation
is to use the Livebook desktop app that you can find [on its website][livebook].

This is a guide to using Tile38 in Elixir. It uses Livebook to interact with the in-memory, real-time spatial database. The goal is to give a high-level overview of Tile38's capabilities with interactive snippets you can run on your own machine.
